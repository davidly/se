Seconds. An extremely simple Windows clock that shows seconds.

The clock in the Windows 11 taskbar no long displays seconds when clicked on. How do you know when exactly to join your Teams meeting?

SE remembers where it was last positioned. To clear that and start at a default location, pass anything on the command line.

Example:
